## Tell us what your idea is.

TryB4Shop, as the name suggests the user can try the items before he/ she buys the product. The app is basically made for low end Android devices. First, the user has to give the known measurements of reference object then select the end points of body part which height/ width to be measured. Based upon the known reference object dimensions, the app will give the dimensions of selected part. According to that the products suitable for that size will be displayed. Afterwards, a user can select the product and try it on the body part. If user likes it then he can make the purchase and pay via cryptocurrency of his/ her choice.
We can leverage the power of ondevice machine learning (TensorFlow Lite) for body part detection and fit the object perfectly on it. Since now, we are doing it manually. Also, we can user ARCore to make the whole transaction in realtime. We can host it on GoogleCloud & use Google Pay based payments to make it scalable.
After gathering a lot of data from users, we can create models which can predict the exact items user will buy based upon his/ her body part's size, color, region, etc. You can see the app in action in the following video where, I've taken the example of shoes:
